sparkSQL is faster than just using python. pypy improves a python implementation, but has little effect on sparkSQL implementation.

PyPy made a huge difference in reddit-averages, not so much when using sparkSQL. in reddit-averages a lot of work is being done by python, so a faster python implementation would improve performance. With the sparkSQL version a lot of the work is actually being done by scala, so the python implementation has little effect.
