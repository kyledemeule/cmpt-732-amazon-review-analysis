Note on commit history:
I originally had one github repository for all my assignments and project, I spun out the project folder after starting it for a bit so the commit history has assignment and project commits mixed in. I was pretty good with prefixing the commit messages though so all the relevant project ones should start like "PROJECT ...".

To run the scraper spider:
```
scrapy runspider scrapy_most_helpful.py -o amz.json
```
